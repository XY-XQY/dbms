🔹 1. Find different locations from where employees belong.
SELECT DISTINCT Address 
FROM Employee;

🔹 2. Find maximum and minimum salary.
SELECT MAX(Salary) AS Max_Salary, MIN(Salary) AS Min_Salary 
FROM Employee;

🔹 3. Display employee table in ascending order of salary.
SELECT * 
FROM Employee 
ORDER BY Salary ASC;

🔹 4. Find names of employees who live in Nasik or Pune.
SELECT EName 
FROM Employee 
WHERE Address IN ('Nasik', 'Pune');

🔹 5. Find names of employees who do not get commission.
SELECT EName 
FROM Employee 
WHERE Commission IS NULL OR Commission = 0;

🔹 6. Change the city of Amit to Nashik.

SET Address = 'Nashik'
WHERE EName = 'Amit';

SELECT * 
FROM Employee 
WHERE EName LIKE 'A%';

🔹 8. Find the count of staff from Mumbai.
SELECT COUNT(*) AS Mumbai_Staff
FROM Employee
WHERE Address = 'Mumbai';

🔹 9. Find the count of staff from each city.
SELECT Address AS City, COUNT(*) AS Staff_Count
FROM Employee
GROUP BY Address;

🔹 10. Find addresses where employees are from and projects are located.
SELECT DISTINCT E.Address
FROM Employee E
JOIN Project P ON E.Address = P.Addr;


🧠 Explanation:
Shows cities common to both employees and project locations.

🔹 11. Find city-wise minimum salary.
SELECT Address AS City, MIN(Salary) AS Min_Salary
FROM Employee
GROUP BY Address;

🔹 12. Find city-wise maximum salary having maximum salary greater than 26000.
SELECT Address AS City, MAX(Salary) AS Max_Salary
FROM Employee
GROUP BY Address
HAVING MAX(Salary) > 26000;

🔹 13. Delete employees having salary greater than 30000.
DELETE FROM Employee
WHERE Salary > 30000;
